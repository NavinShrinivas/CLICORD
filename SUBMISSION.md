## Abstract of project 

The aim was to build a entire CLI focused chat app using golang, but not just any simple chat app. We implemented the following feature on top of basic chat system : 
- Emojis support (Yes, emojis in terminal!)
- File transfer 
- Lobby based chat system 
- Stateless websockets system 

We surely wanted to do more on this project such as : 
- End to end encryption 
- TUI [We had quit nasty bugs on CLI ]
- Work out an authentication system for one on one chatting 
- Ofc a fast as hell backend for storing messages.

But given the time frame of just ~5hrs for this project, all the following could not be done.

**Server :** 

We have a global server hosting out server program, using Dynamic DNS and Little port forwarding we made our server accessible from catss.me:8080 [its just a laptop so its down most of the time :'( ], anyways, the screenshot :
